This step assumes you have followed the [installation](/sdks/typescript/installation) steps and initialized the client.

### Presigned Urls

If you are looking for a way to allow external users to download objects from your bucket, you should check out [Get object with presigned url](/sdks/typescript/presigned-url)

## Get an Object using the StorageSyncClient

The example belows shows how we would get an object/file called list-of-cats.txt and save it to a file called list-of-cats.txt.

```ts index.ts
import { StorageSyncClient } from "@storagesync/client";
import fs from "fs";

const client = new StorageSyncClient({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  bucket: "<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>",
});

const response = await client.download("list-of-cats.txt");
// The response will be a standard fetch response object
// with the body being the data for the object.

const data = await response.text();

fs.writeFileSync("list-of-cats.txt", data);

// Now there should be a file called list-of-cats.txt in the current directory.
```
