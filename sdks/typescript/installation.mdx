## Installation

The StorageSync Node.js client provides a simple and efficient way to interact with your StorageSync buckets directly from your Node.js applications. This client abstracts away the complexities of our API, allowing you to easily upload, download, and manage files in your StorageSync buckets.

## Initializing the Client

To initialize the client with your access key and secret key, you can use the following code:

import { StorageSyncClient } from "@storagesync/client";

const client = new StorageSyncClient({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",

});
```

To find your access key and secret key, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your StorageSync account.
2. Navigate to your bucket.
3. Click on settings.
4. There you should see your bucket name and secret access key.
