let chunkCount = 1;
const CHUNK_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
const uploadedParts: Array<{ partNumber: number; etag: string }> = [];
const stream = fs.createReadStream("./list-of-cats.txt", {
  highWaterMark: CHUNK_SIZE,
});

for await (const data of stream) {
  const etag = await client.uploadPart({
    key: KEY,
    uploadId: uploadId,
    partNumber: chunkCount,
    data,
  });

  if (etag) {
    uploadedParts.push({ partNumber: chunkCount, etag });
    chunkCount++;
